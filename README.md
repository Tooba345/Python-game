# 🌠 Shooting Stars Python Game

 
Built with the help of [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) and [Khan Academy’s Python tutorials](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

## 🎮 About the Game

In **Shooting Stars**, the player(which is a astronaut) controls a basket that moves left and right to catch stars while avoiding UFOs. The background is a galaxy theme, creating a fast-paced and engaging space adventure!

## 🚀 Features

- Custom galaxy-themed game design
- Smooth player movement using keyboard input
- Collision detection for falling stars and UFOs
- Score system
- Game Over and Restart mechanics
- Sound effects (optional depending on version)
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pygame** (for graphics and game loop)
- Custom logic from scratch (no game engine used)
- CS50 & Khan Academy concepts (loops, lists, classes, functions)

## 🧠 What I Learned

This was my **first real game project**, and I learned:
- How to structure a Python game using OOP
- Handling input, game loops, and events
- Managing multiple objects (stars, UFOs, player)
- Debugging and refining a playable game over time
- How to change the speed of the UFOs and Stars with each level 

## 🕒 Timeline

- Started: **Early October 2024**
- Completed first version: **Late December 2024**
- Improvements and polish: **January–February 2025**
