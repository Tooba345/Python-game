# 🌠 Shooting Stars Python Game

 
Built with the help of [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) and [Khan Academy’s Python tutorials](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).
Presented my project in Techno show a event hosted my Farah Ubaid the CEO of Affreej on 15th Feb 2025, there the mentors appreciated my efforts. Also gave me their advices about how to enhance my game features such as how to change the speed of the objects and how to apply collision logic more effectively. Fallowing their instructions I was able to make a better user friendly game.

## 🎮 About the Game

In **Shooting Stars**, the player(which is a astronaut) controls a basket that moves left and right to catch stars while avoiding UFOs. The background is a galaxy theme, creating a fast-paced and engaging space adventure!

## 🚀 Features

- Custom galaxy-themed game design
- Smooth player movement using keyboard input
- Collision detection for falling stars and UFOs
- Score system
- Game Over and Restart mechanics
  
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pygame** (for graphics and game loop)
- Custom logic from scratch (no game engine used)
- CS50 & Khan Academy concepts (loops, lists, classes, functions)

## 🧠 What I Learned

This was my **first real game project**, and I learned:
- How to structure a Python game using OOP
- Handling input, game loops, and events
- Managing multiple objects (stars, UFOs, player)
- Debugging and refining a playable game over time
- How to change the speed of the UFOs and Stars with each level 

## 🕒 Timeline

- Started: **Early October 2024**
- Completed first version: **Late December 2024**
- Improvements and polish: **January–February 2025**

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install Python 3 and Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
